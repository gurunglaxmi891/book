                              <p>It is a self-help book by Mark Manson that explores the concept of Hope and its role in our lives. Our modern world is full of distractions and that we often fill our lives with the meaningless activities to distract ourselves from the bigger questions about life. Hope is essential to our well-being and happiness, but we often place our hope in the wrong things.
